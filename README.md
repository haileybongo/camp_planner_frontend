Welcome to Camp Planner! This is the front end of a camping trip planning application. This is not currently deployed and is set to run on local host. To get this up and running, clone this repository as well as the back end repository. Once the back end is installed and the server is running, run open 'index.html' on this repository.


This project is an application for users to store and plan camping trips. There is a campsite search feature that calls to the National Park Service API as well as some built in packing lists. Users can create trips by adding the location, campsite, arrival & departure dates, and attaching a packing list. Trips will be saved for future viewing.
